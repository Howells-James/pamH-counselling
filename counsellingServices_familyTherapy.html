					<h2> <font size="4"> Family Therapy: </font></h2>
					 <p> <font size="2"><i>"Good family therapy creates an environment where conversations that should happen at home,
					 but don't, can take place". - Nichols and Schwart, 2004 </font> </i> </p>
					 
					 <ul>
						<li>If you would like to engage in some family counselling I will talk to you first to better understand what is going on in the family and suggest  who should come along to the first session. Anyone who could potentially contribute to helping with the problem is welcome. It is important for family members to know they have a choice. </li>
						<li>After the first meeting membership can be decided on a session by session basis.</li>
						<li>Family therapy is not about blaming any one person for a family issue, but about trying to understand what actions, behaviours and family dynamics are contributing to the problem/s and doing things differently in the future so the problem/s retreat or go away. </li>
						<li>Family therapy is more likely to be successful if family members can come to their session with a spirit of goodwill and generosity and engage in a reflective stance rather than adopting a reactive stance. As therapist I can help you with adopting the most beneficial stance from which successful therapy can take place </li>
						<li>If possible, it is important that everyone's unique perspective in the family system is heard, as each person's contribution is a valuable resource from which solutions can be found </li>
						<li>I practice from a constructionist perspective, which means that meaning is not communicated from therapist to client but is generated conjointly and is different from the contribution of either party. </li>
						<li>The goals and direction of therapy are co-constructed, and clients are encouraged to be authorities on their own troubles and dilemmas. </li>
						<li>In order to ensure the safety of all family members or make other value based decisions I will, however, use my professional authority if I think necessary, and on exceptional occasions may stop a session. </li>
