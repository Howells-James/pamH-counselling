                    <hr class="visible-xs">
                    <p> <font size="2"><i>"The goal of therapy is to participate in a conversation that continually 
					loosens and opens up, rather than constricts and closes down. Through therapeutic 
					conversations, fixed meanings and behaviours…are given room, broadened, shifted, and changed." - Anderson and Goolishian, 1988</font></i></p>
					
					<p>
					Counselling is a unique experience for everyone – 
					that’s because you, your relationship or family are all unique!
					</p>
					
					<p>
					 The terms counselling, therapy and psychotherapy are all terms used to describe the process of
					 meeting with a trained therapeutic professional who will help you work out what’s going on for you, 
					 that’s causing you emotional discomfort/distress or causing you to think or behave in
					 ways not consistent with your preferred way of thinking or behaving. 
					</p>
					
					<p>
					Counselling will help you work out why you are feeling and/or acting in a certain way and help you 
					in changing unhelpful mental habits, non- beneficial patterned behaviours and disabling thoughts and emotions.
					</p>
					
					<p>
					Counselling is about providing you with a safe and trusting environment whereby you feel comfortable
					talking about issues that are of concern to you and/or your loved ones. Counselling is a private and 
					confidential process whereby everything talked about is kept confidential. There are some exceptions
					to this that I will talk about during the first meeting, but I will always discuss with you first, if 
					I need to break your confidentiality. 
					</p>
					
					<h2 class="intro-text text-center"> <strong>Counselling can help you...</strong></h2>
					<hr>
					<ul>
						
						<li>Explore emotions, thoughts and behaviours, which may be puzzling, uncomfortable or distressing for you.
							Understanding more about your thoughts, emotions and behaviours can help you gain more control over them.</li>
					
						<li>Improve your relationship with yourself and others including your family/whanau and loved ones.</li>
					
						<li>Acquaint yourself with what you value in life and find new meanings, understandings and awareness of yourself and others.</li>
					
						<li>Find peace, contentment and fulfilment through reducing stress/anxiety and expanding possibilities.</li>
					
						<li>Bring about positive change in your life and help you move forward towards the life you want to and deserve.</li>
					
						<li>Equip yourself with beneficial parenting strategies, so you can be the best parent you can for your children</li>
					
						<li>Create for yourself and your family a fulfilling life</li>
						
					</ul>
					
					<h2 class="intro-text text-center"> <strong>What counselling is not</strong></h2>
					<hr>
					<ul>
						<li>Counselling is not about diagnosing or pathologizing you, or encouraging you to comply to ‘normative’ standards  </li>
						<li>Counselling is not about giving advice or telling you what to do in your life, however, together we will explore a number
							of possibilities that you can then decide upon </li>
						<li>Counselling is not about taking sides or disrespecting anyone in a counselling relationship</li>
						<li>Counselling is not a process to convince a third party (a judge, lawyer, CYF’s social worker) that your behaviour/s have 
							changed, but a counsellor can validate that you are or have attended counselling </li>
